Support example
===============

The goal: edit calculate-shared-counts.py and  calculate-95-percent-cutoff.py until the test script:

    $ sh run_tests.sh

completes without any failures.

When you accomplish that, running

    $ sh calc_support.sh 

should produce an answer for a large data set.
